## 💡 MESSAGING FOR INVESTORS

### **Opening Hook:**
> "Every year, drought causes $13 billion in agricultural losses in Europe alone. Farmers find out too late - when they see brown fields. We detect it from space, weeks earlier, using physics."

### **Problem Statement:**
> "Current drought detection is visual and slow. By the time you see brown crops, it's too late. Satellites can see soil moisture invisibly, but analysis is manual and expensive."

### **Solution:**
> "AerisQ is an AI-powered early warning system. We use radar satellites that penetrate clouds, analyze soil physics, and deliver drought alerts in seconds - not weeks."

### **Why Now:**
- ✅ Climate change accelerating droughts
- ✅ Satellite data now abundant (Sentinel-1 is free)
- ✅ Cloud computing makes analysis instant
- ✅ Google Earth Engine democratizes access
- ✅ Farmers adopting digital tools

### **Traction:**
> "We built a working product in 2 weeks. It's live, it works, and we're ready to scale. We need funding to: (1) Get beta customers, (2) Activate real satellite data, (3) Build sales pipeline."

### **Ask:**
> "We're raising $100k-$250k seed to validate product-market fit. Use of funds: $50k customer acquisition, $50k product development, $50k operations for 12 months."
